# import-apple-reminders.sh — migrate Apple Reminders into Tasks.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/import-apple-reminders.sh [DB_PATH] [EXPORT_FILE]
#
#   DB_PATH     — the Tasks database (default:
#                 ~/.local/share/tasks/tasks.db).
#   EXPORT_FILE — a previously produced export to (re)import, skipping
#                 the AppleScript step (mainly for testing/reruns).
#
# What it does:
#   1. Exports every Reminders list and reminder via AppleScript (name,
#      notes, due date, completed + completion date).  Property fetches
#      are BATCHED per list — one Apple Event per property, not one per
#      reminder — so large databases export in seconds.  The first run
#      pops macOS's automation-permission prompt for Reminders.
#   2. Imports into the Tasks database with python3 (stdlib
#      sqlite3): lists are matched by name (existing lists are reused),
#      tasks are appended after existing ones, and a task whose exact
#      title already exists in the target list is skipped — so the
#      script is safe to re-run.
#
# Notes / limitations:
#   - Tasks must NOT be running (no CLI/socket like Blue Notes; the
#     script writes the database directly).
#   - Apple exposes NO API for Reminders subtasks — they import as
#     top-level tasks of their list.
#   - Reminder due TIMES are dropped (Tasks due dates are date-only,
#     matching what Google Tasks can sync); priorities and flags are not
#     carried over.
#   - Imported rows are stamped dirty: the NEXT SYNC PUSHES THEM ALL to
#     Google Tasks.  Import 500 reminders, expect 500 creations there.
