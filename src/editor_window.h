/* ===========================================================================
 * editor_window.h — the per-task editor window for Lists
 *
 * One window per task (double-click in the library), tracked in
 * app->editors keyed by task id.  Edits all task properties — title,
 * notes, due date, status, pinned — plus the task's attachments and (for
 * top-level tasks) its subtasks.  Subtasks cannot have subtasks: editing
 * a subtask shows a "part of" note instead of a subtask section.
 *
 * Status is a New / In Progress / Done dropdown, the full tri-state
 * (db.h): the task list's checkbox column can only reach two of those
 * three values, so this is the only place In Progress can be chosen
 * outright.
 *
 * Saves are write-through with a short debounce (like the Notes
 * editor autosave): every change lands in the database within ~600 ms
 * and the library refreshes.  Closing the window flushes a pending save.
 * A task mirroring a Notes action item is no different here — its
 * status and due reach Notes with the next mirror pass (bnsync.h),
 * never from this window, and Notes sees only whether the status is
 * Done.
 *
 * Subtasks and Attachments are folded away behind an "Advanced" link at
 * the foot of the window: collapsed for a task that has neither, expanded
 * on open for one that already does.  Expanding grows the window by that
 * block's own height and collapsing gives the same pixels back.
 *
 * The foot row also carries a Save button (flush the pending save and
 * close) at the right of every editor; the New Task variant adds Cancel
 * to its right — see bt_editor_open_new().
