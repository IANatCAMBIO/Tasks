/* ===========================================================================
 * gtasks.h — two-way Google Tasks sync for Tasks
 *
 * Sync model
 * ----------
 * Every local list/task carries a `gtasks_id` (its Google-side identity)
 * and an `updated_at` stamp; sync_state.last_sync records when the last
 * successful sync STARTED.  One sync pass:
 *
 *   pull the remote state → match rows by gtasks_id →
 *     local tombstone            → DELETE remote, purge local
 *     local row, no gtasks_id    → POST (create remote), adopt the new id
 *     remote row, no local match → create local (clean, remote stamp)
 *     remote deleted             → purge local (deletion wins)
 *     both present               → newer `updated` wins; the loser is
 *                                  overwritten (local applies keep the
 *                                  REMOTE stamp so the row ends clean)
 *
 * Only the FIRST pass pulls the full remote task state; later passes
 * fetch incrementally (updatedMin = last_sync - 300s skew overlap), and
 * a task absent from such a partial listing means UNCHANGED — it is
 * still pushed if locally dirty, and never treated as deleted
 * (deletions arrive as deleted:true items).
 *
 * First-sync dedup: an unmatched local list adopts an unmatched remote
 * list with the same name (and likewise tasks by title within a list)
 * instead of creating a duplicate; the task-title dedup only runs
 * against a full listing.
 *
 * Google Tasks maps cleanly onto the schema: tasklists ↔ lists, tasks ↔
 * tasks, `parent` ↔ parent_id (the API supports exactly the one nesting
 * level Tasks allows).  `pinned` and attachments have no Google
 * counterpart and stay local-only.  Task order is not synced.
 *
 * Threading: the whole pass runs on a worker thread with its OWN SQLite
 * connection (a connection must not cross threads); status/completion
 * are marshalled to the main thread with g_idle_add.  The GUI keeps
 * writing during a sync — SQLite's busy timeout serializes the writes,
 * and anything changed mid-sync is simply picked up by the next pass.
